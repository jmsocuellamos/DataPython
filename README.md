## Diabetes

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

## Cancer

Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
n the 3-dimensional space is that described in: [K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: "Robust Linear Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets", Optimization Methods and Software 1, 1992, 23-34].

This database is also available through the UW CS ftp server:
ftp ftp.cs.wisc.edu
cd math-prog/cpo-dataset/machine-learn/WDBC/

Also can be found on UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29

Attribute Information:

1) ID number
2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)
3-32)

Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
c) perimeter
d) area
e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
i) symmetry
j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

The mean, standard error and "worst" or largest (mean of the three
largest values) of these features were computed for each image,
resulting in 30 features. For instance, field 3 is Mean Radius, field
13 is Radius SE, field 23 is Worst Radius.

All feature values are recoded with four significant digits.

## Avocado prices

It is a well known fact that Millenials LOVE Avocado Toast. It's also a well known fact that all Millenials live in their parents basements. Clearly, they aren't buying home because they are buying too much Avocado Toast! But maybe there's hope… if a Millenial could find a city with cheap avocados, they could live out the Millenial American Dream.

This data was downloaded from the Hass Avocado Board website in May of 2018 & compiled into a single CSV. Here's how the Hass Avocado Board describes the data on their website:

The table below represents weekly 2018 retail scan data for National retail volume (units) and price. Retail scan data comes directly from retailers’ cash registers based on actual retail sales of Hass avocados. Starting in 2013, the table below reflects an expanded, multi-outlet retail data set. Multi-outlet reporting includes an aggregation of the following channels: grocery, mass, club, drug, dollar and military. The Average Price (of avocados) in the table reflects a per unit (per avocado) cost, even when multiple units (avocados) are sold in bags. The Product Lookup codes (PLU’s) in the table are only for Hass avocados. Other varieties of avocados (e.g. greenskins) are not included in this table.

Some relevant columns in the dataset:

Date - The date of the observation
AveragePrice - the average price of a single avocado
type - conventional or organic
year - the year
Region - the city or region of the observation
Total Volume - Total number of avocados sold
4046 - Total number of avocados with PLU 4046 sold
4225 - Total number of avocados with PLU 4225 sold
4770 - Total number of avocados with PLU 4770 sold

## Mushrooms

Although this dataset was originally contributed to the UCI Machine Learning repository nearly 30 years ago, mushroom hunting (otherwise known as "shrooming") is enjoying new peaks in popularity. Learn which features spell certain death and which are most palatable in this dataset of mushroom characteristics. And how certain can your model be?

This dataset includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family Mushroom drawn from The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981). Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended. This latter class was combined with the poisonous one. The Guide clearly states that there is no simple rule for determining the edibility of a mushroom; no rule like "leaflets three, let it be'' for Poisonous Oak and Ivy.

## Housing

This is the dataset used in the second chapter of Aurélien Géron's recent book 'Hands-On Machine learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow'. It serves as an excellent introduction to implementing machine learning algorithms because it requires rudimentary data cleaning, has an easily understandable list of variables and sits at an optimal size between being to toyish and too cumbersome.

The data contains information from the 1990 California census. So although it may not help you with predicting current housing prices like the Zillow Zestimate dataset, it does provide an accessible introductory dataset for teaching people about the basics of machine learning.

## Air_population_seoul

This dataset deals with air pollution measurement information in Seoul, South Korea.
Seoul Metropolitan Government provides many public data, including air pollution information, through the 'Open Data Plaza'
I made a structured dataset by collecting and adjusting various air pollution related datasets provided by the Seoul Metropolitan Government

## winequality-red

Context

This datasets is related to red variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. For more details, consult the reference [Cortez et al., 2009]. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.). This dataset is also available from the UCI machine learning repository, https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality , I just shared it to kaggle for convenience. (If I am mistaken and the public license type disallowed me from doing so, I will take this down if requested.)

Content

For more information, read [Cortez et al., 2009].
Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):
1) fixed acidity (most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile (do not evaporate readily))
2) volatile acidity (the amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste)
3) citric acid (found in small quantities, citric acid can add 'freshness' and flavor to wines)
4) residual sugar (the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, it's rare to find wines with less than 1 gram/liter and wines with greater than)
5) chlorides (the amount of salt in the wine)
6) free sulfur dioxide (the free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion; it prevents)
7) total sulfur dioxide (amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2)
8) density (the density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content)
9) pH (describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4 on the)
10) sulphates (a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, wich acts as an antimicrobial and)

## Iris Flower Dataset

The Iris flower data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems. It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris Setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

The dataset contains a set of 150 records under 5 attributes - Petal Length, Petal Width, Sepal Length, Sepal width and Class(Species).
